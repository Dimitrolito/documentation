The Royalty Module defines how revenue flows between parent and child IP Assets. There are two common scenarios when revenue flow would happen:

1. Minting a License - sometimes there is a minting fee to mint a [License Token](doc:license-token) from an IP Asset. When this is paid by someone (who wants to register a derivative or simply hold a license), the revenue should flow up the chain.
2. Tipping Directly - if someone sends revenue to an IP Asset directly, it should flow up the chain.

The below example (using [Liquid Absolute Percentage](doc:policy-liquid-absolute-percentage)) shows what happens when an IP Asset 4 (IPA4) tips IPA3 1M USDC.

1. Revenue first flows to the Royalty Module contract
2. Royalty Module sends USDC to both IPA3 and the LAP contract based on the **royalty stack** (15%)
3. LAP will distribute funds to further ancestors since they have negotiated some license agreement where they are due revenue from IPA3's earnings. 

**Don't worry if you don't understand everything in the picture, this is just to show you an overview of what the Royalty Module is all about.**

## Royalty Policies

Royalty policies are a component of the license agreement between two IP Assets. It defines how revenue flow actually happens.

The Royalty Module supports both whitelisted/native policies created by our team directly, and external ones created by you.

> ðŸ“˜ Note on Royalty Policies
> 
> An IP Asset without any parents can mint licenses with different royalty policies while a derivative IP Asset inherits the royalty policy of its parents.
> 
> Additionally, there will always be one royalty policy governing every link an IP Asset has with each of its derivatives.

### Whitelisted/Native Royalty Policies

These policies require governance whitelisting and guarantee royalty token distribution to ancestors.

1. [Liquid Absolute Percentage (LAP)](doc:liquid-absolute-percentage)
2. [Liquid Relative Percentage (LRP)](doc:liquid-relative-percentage)

### External Royalty Policies

These policies can be registered in a permission-less way and stipulate their own royalty and revenue distribution rules.

## Derivative Chain Configurations

![](https://files.readme.io/79bd27f-image.png)

The derivative chain can assume multiple configurations. 

Each IP Asset is restricted to a total royalty % of 100%. It will revert when minting a license that would make the IPA reserve more than 100% of its royalty tokens for ancestors, since this would make no sense.

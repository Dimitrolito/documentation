This arbitration policy is a dispute resolution mechanism that follows [UMA's](https://uma.xyz/) rules. Below we share a high-level overview of how the UMA dispute process works.

1. Raise Dispute - The first step to initiate a dispute against an IP Asset is to call the `raiseDispute` function on [DisputeModule.sol](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-core-v1/blob/main/contracts/modules/dispute/DisputeModule.sol). This function will in turn call `assertTruth` on UMA's `OptimisticOracleV3.sol`. To initiate a dispute the dispute initiator will need to post a bond of at least the minimum bond defined by UMA for the selected currency.
2. (Optional) Dispute Assertion / Counter Dispute - After this call there is a period of time called liveness in which a counter dispute can be submitted. The liveness period is split in two parts: (i) the first part of the liveness period in which only the IP owner can counter dispute and (ii) a second part in which any address can counter dispute - which can be done by calling `disputeAssertion` on `ArbitrationPolicyUMA.sol`. To counter a dispute the caller will need to post a bond of the same amount and currency that was used by the dispute initiator when raising a dispute.
3. Settle Assertion 
   1. If nobody submitted a counter dispute then when the liveness period is over, any address can call `settleAssertion` on UMA's `OptimisticOracleV3.sol`.
   2. If somebody has submitted a counter dispute before the liveness period is over, then the dispute is escalated to UMA decision makers who will judge and make a decision on whether the IP is infringing or not. After the decision has been made, then any address can call `settleAssertion` on UMA's `OptimisticOracleV3.sol`.
